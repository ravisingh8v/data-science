Q.1 Perform calculation and creating parameter in tableau
Ans:
A calculation is often referred to as a Calculated Field in Tableau because, in most cases, when you 
create a calculation, it will show up as either a new measure or dimension in the data pane. 

Two main type of calculation :
- Row-level calculations: These calculations are performed for every row of underlying data. 
- Aggregate calculations: These calculations are performed at an aggregate level, which is usually 
  defined by the dimensions used in the view.
