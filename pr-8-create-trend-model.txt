###Analyzing Trend Lines
it can helpful to observe trend lines, but often we want to understand whether the trend model we've selected is statistically meaningful.

- we can analyze the line by hover on it
- additionally, we can see more detail on Analysis | trend lines | describe model


#Exporting statistical model details

For exporting 

- go to worksheet which is on main menu
- go to export 
- click on Data
- then choose the file path
- click export


2. Use same for the Forecasting
- Create same view as we created in Population
